                <h2>Secret Pigeon</h2>
                <p>We use end-to-end encryption using Public-Private key cryptography. This means security without
                    having to distribute encryption keys yourself and without having to trust other parties. Instead of
                    using 3rd party JavaScript code we only use the high-quality API’s provided by modern browsers. As
                    your secrets are encrypted in your browser before being sent, we never see them, and can’t leak
                    them. Source code is available for anyone to review and is served directly by GitHub. Hashes are
                    used to verify message integrity and to prevent tampering. As an extra measure your data is also
                    transferred over TLS and further encrypted using AES when waiting in our data center. </p>

            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2>We are different</h2>
                <p>Other popular secret sharing sites either don’t support end to end encryption or require you to
                    provide your own encryption keys, which then must be shared with your intended recipient; leaving
                    you back where you started. Even if you trust owners of the site to transfer your secrets without
                    peeking there is still the potential risk of information being leaked accidentally from the site due
                    to bugs or hacks, possibly without anybody being aware. Features such as links which only work once
                    don’t do anything to mitigate these risks as you still can’t know that your secret was securely
                    removed from all servers and logs. </p>

                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>During World War II the British intelligence service air dropped carrier pigeons across occupied
                    Europe. These pigeons came with instructions for resistance groups to record encrypted intelligence
                    reports. The reports were attached to the pigeons which flew them safely across enemy lines and back
                    to allied command.</p>
