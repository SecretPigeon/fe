                <h2>Secret Pigeon</h2>
                <p>We use end-to-end encryption using Public-Private key cryptography. This means security without
                    having to distribute encryption keys yourself and without having to trust other parties. Instead of
                    using 3rd party JavaScript code we only use the high-quality API’s provided by modern browsers. As
                    your secrets are encrypted in your browser before being sent, we never see them, and can’t leak
                    them. Source code is available for anyone to review and is served directly from GitHub via our CDN Cloudfront. Hashes are
                    used to verify message integrity and prevent tampering. As an extra measure your data is also
                    transferred over TLS and further encrypted using AES when waiting inside our data center. </p>

                  <h2>Browser Support</h2>
                <p>Modern encryption requires modern browsers. Please make sure you are using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox Quantum, Microsoft Edge, Safari or Opera berfore using this site. We are unable to support Internet Explorer or Opera Mini.</p>

                <h2>Our inspiration</h2>
                <p>During World War II the British intelligence service air dropped carrier pigeons across occupied
                    Europe. These pigeons came with instructions for resistance groups to record encrypted intelligence
                    reports. The reports were attached to the pigeons which flew them safely across enemy lines and back
                    to allied command.</p>
